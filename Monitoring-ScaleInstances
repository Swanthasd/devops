For monitoring:- we have to enable cloudwatch and create custom alarms/alerts. We can enable cloudtrail & config to monitor the
aws api and other service calls to monitor.
For scale up/down we can use ELB and autoscaling, when the load increases it will automatically spin up instance
from the ami, in case load is low as per defined threshold it will scale down the instance.

For config management we are using Chef.
